            <h2>
                What is Bluexthermal’s 
                (BXT) thin film, on the chip (OTC), 
                evaporative cooling ?
            </h2>
            <p>
                BXT’s technology has a few defining characteristics over other types of 2 phase cooling.
                The Primary difference is that it is continuous meniscus. This means that unlike boiling
                where the bubbles form a meniscus which then grows and collapses, our technology
                allows for a much more stable and predictable evaporation mechanism. (see diagram).
                Before adding multiple blades into the mix, we also have a 3D component on every
                single blade in the form of the micro channels. This means that there is more overall
                surface area that can form a thin film region which is required for efficient 2 phase
                evaporation. This compares to boiling (or nucleated boiling) in which the total thin film
                surface area can’t exceed the area of the heat source. When the chip is set on top, the
                blades heat up and the many microchannels draw up the water like a sponge, setting the
                stage for the meniscus and the 2 phase evaporation to take place. The vapor escape (line)
                is through a side portal and can travel a great distance.<br><br>
                The second characteristic is the 3D structure formed by combining multiple blades
                stacked vertically along the face of the heat source. This has four benefits; (1) the first
                being additional active surface area for evaporation closer to the heat source, (2) the
                second is a dedicated vapor space to allow the vapor to freely leave the device and
                transport the collected heat away to whatever desired rejection system is desired in the
                application, (3) the third is a continuous liquid feed to the active site that has very high
                flow capacity per square area of heat source. This means the device can serve other
                applications where temperatures may be higher, but overall power density is above
                10MW/m^2, where nearly every other 2 phase technology we are aware of fails due to
                dryout on any scale larger than ~1cmx1cm, and (4) the fourth benefit is that we can work
                with a bulk liquid pool. This allows a number of advantageous configurations such as
                immersion cooling, or alternatively in a closed loop configuration, and allows the heat to
                be carried much further from the source in a form that is higher quality heat to possibly
                be used similar to co-generation.<br><br>
                The BXT prototype testing used an Intel 10900 with the heat spreader removed against
                the copper surface above the blades (see prototype photo). The patent provides for it, and
                we believe the final endpoint of an “on the chip” set up may likely come in the form of
                implementing the technology directly into the silicon die of the chips. This would
                eliminate a number of critical thermal resistances which inhibit overall system
                performance. In a typical small/medium die size CPU situation, only ~⅓ of the
                temperature rise seen between the heat source and heat sink comes from the performance
                of the cooling technology. The other ⅔ come from the thermal interfaces and extra
                material required for structural integrity. With an etched on die approach, this could
                likely remove more than ½ of the currently unavailable losses. However, the difficulty of
                making a system work directly on the die is twofold. First, it needs to handle heat at a
                much higher power density as there will be no opportunity to spread the heat laterally
                (Taking heat load of a typical CPU from 1MW/m^2 to &gt;2.5MW/m^2). This is not
                necessarily a problem in the heat range of today’s CPU’s. However, as the nodes
                continue to shrink, the power density has only grown, not to mention stacked chip
                architectures. The second challenge is that it needs to be low force and non-abrasive. Due
                to this, single phase approaches that are able to handle the necessary heat load are
                typically not suitable for integration directly into the silicon, which leaves them at a
                significant disadvantage vs. 2 phase,, having to bond to the silicon increasing thermal
                resistance.

            <h2>
                What is it about thin film evaporative cooling that promises better chip cooling
                than traditional water cooling or immersion cooling ( boiling) ? Other advantages.
            </h2>
            <p>
                As a general principle, 2-phase cooling is much more powerful than single phase.
                Liquid water has a heat capacity of 4j/g*K, while evaporation carries away 2260j/g (at
                nearly 0 degrees delta T). This means that to get a similar cooling performance, you
                either need to pump 500x more liquid, or accept a much higher delta T between the
                heat source and the working fluid. Ultimately from the literature and experiments BXT
                conducted, this results in performance in the range of 100kW/m^2*K. With boiling, in
                an immersion cooling scenario we expect that to be much lower (note: have not been able
                to find reliable sources for current state of the art for immersion boiling). Without fully
                optimizing, we have simulated versions of our prototype/structure that should yield
                performance between 250-300kW/m^2*K. This performance would also be expected to
                hold up even in an immersion setup, by simply latching on the BXT device. We believe
                that this step alone would yield significant benefits for most existing immersion
                technologies.

            <h2>
                Bluexthermal succeeded in building and testing a prototype of its technology which
                was compared in a side by side test with an established water block cooling product.
                What do those results suggest to us ?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The BXT prototype was able to confirm a few things, but also highlighted a number of
                steps that need to be completed to achieve full theoretical performance. We were able to
                construct a full closed loop system that had a performance on par with today’s highest
                performance off the shelf waterblocks, but operated on the principles of 3D continuous
                meniscus thin film evaporation.<br><br>

                This took the technology a step beyond the work performed at the University of Virginia
                (UVA) which was mostly done in an open system with materials, heat sources, and
                working fluids designed only to prove the underlying physics instead of maximizing heat
                removal in a real world environment. These experiments performed at BXT were able to
                show that in a relatively similar form-factor to existing technologies, we could construct a
                working system that did not show any fundamental pitfalls. During this round of<br><br>

                experimentation however, we were not able to achieve performance levels as high as
                what is predicted by the theoretical models. We believe the number one contributor to
                this was the lack of a robust super hydrophilic coating that is needed to achieve the
                theoretical thin film geometry. In the UVA experiments this was not an issue due to the
                working fluid and substrate materials involved, which naturally form a near 0 degree
                contact angle, but are not necessarily ideal for a real world heat rejection system.
                Between the two sets of experiments performed between UVA and BXT, we believe that
                we proved the theoretical basis for the design, as well as confirmed that any remaining
                work to get to a full performance real world model is merely an engineering challenge
                rather than an exercise of pure science.
